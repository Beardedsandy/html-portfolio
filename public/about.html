<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>As a Business (Marketing) Graduate with over 5 years of experience, I've been deeply involved in managing different aspects of a small manufacturing business, including sales, finances, and day-to-day tasks. This was especially important to me as it was my family's business back in India. Now, I've transitioned to the vibrant landscape of UAE where I work as a Marketing Executive in an advertising company. 
</p>

<p>In my current role, I use my skills in communication, design, and understanding markets to help the business grow and meet sales goals. Before this role, I freelanced in digital marketing, using social media platforms and Google ads to make brands more visible, attract leads, and improve online ads. This experience taught me a lot about the synergy between sales and digital marketing for exponential growth.</p>

<p>I'm good with Adobe Creative Suite and Microsoft Office, which helps me make attractive content and presentations for sales. I also love taking professional photos and telling stories through them.

  With my background in marketing and experience in sales and digital marketing, I'm ready to help businesses grow and build strong relationships with clients. I'm always open to meeting new people and speaking about sales strategies and potential partnerships in the industry.</p>
